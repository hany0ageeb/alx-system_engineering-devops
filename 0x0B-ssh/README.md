# 0x0B. SSH

Along with this project, you have been attributed an Ubuntu server, living in a datacenter far far away. Like level 2 of the application process, you will connect using ssh. But contrary to level 2, you will not connect using a password but an RSA key. Weâ€™ve configured your server with the public key you created in the first task of a [previous project](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/UQIQV4HJGvBv0qrHhlDFaQ) shared in your [intranet profile](https://intranet.alxswe.com/rltoken/8ZlNV0J-sa-dijhmhJolOg).
